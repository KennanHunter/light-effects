# Light Effects

[Demo](https://light-effects.kennan.tech/)

A simple svelte project to allow the other programmers on my FTC team to test the logic for various light effects, without wasting time on the actual robot.

Note: This code is very sloppy, focused mainly on just working, not working well. My other projects have significantly higher code quality.
